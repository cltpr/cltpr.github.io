Nestled in the heart of the Meuse, Evres is a charming French ‘commune’ or ‘township’ which has retained the peace and tranquillity of the French countryside.
Your accommodation is a traditional farm cottage, ideal situated to give you access to the local area and tourist activities, such as; walking, hiking and cycling.  Further information can be found [here](/activities_en.html).
In our farm you will have a true ecological approach based on sustainability and respecting Mother Nature.  Details of our eco-friendly approach can be found [here](/ecology_en.html).
Your host, Pierre, will be on hand to show you his hens, jams, pies and vegetable garden. Depending on your preferences, he will be able to provide advice on how to get the most out of the local area. If you want, there is also the opportunity to visit him for a chat, a drink or even share a meal. It is entirely up to you!
