# Arrival

You can park alongside the house and along the garden, on the grass next to the road. There is room for 6 cars. Please don't block the path between the garden and the neighbor's house. Enter the garden through the wooden gate. To the left of the terrace, you have a metal stable door. Be careful, the short descent to get there is slippery if it's wet. There is a safe padlock on the door. The code is the date of your arrival (ddmm) The key opens the patio door to the terrace. Come in and settle in, welcome!!!

# Trash cans

Here are the types of trash cans:
- small black one for food waste, for chickens. You can empty it in the henhouse
- small black for the glass. You can empty it into the cart which is in the stable, by entering on the left. No broken glass please.
- small black one for sorting (the list of what we put in it is on the cardboard sheet placed on top). You can empty it in the yellow trash can, which is at the side of the road or in the courtyard on the other side of the house.
- large stainless steel trash can next to the fireplace: everything else, but normally not much (the broken glass goes there)!!! You can throw the full bags in the red trash can, which is at the side of the road or in the yard on the other side of the house.


# Dishwasher

To start the dishwasher
- you have pods in the bowl just above
- close the door
- press Start
- check that the left dial is on 0 to avoid delayed start
- put the right dial on reset and wait for it to ring
- then choose your program

Under the sink you have rinse aid and salt if needed. If there are no more, call me!

# Dry toilets

Explanatory posters are placed in the toilets. To empty the buckets (it is recommended to do this every day), take them to the stable following the signs. At the end of the barn a poster explains how to proceed with the composter.

# Beds

Each bed has a mattress pad, a pillow and a pillow cover. If you took this option, you will also have a fitted sheet, a sheet and a pillowcase. If not, you are asked to use your own sheets and pillowcases. If you have forgotten them or are missing some, call me and we will make arrangements.

# Garden and leisure
Ball games: ball or Freezbee games are not allowed in the garden, to avoid damaging the plants. To do this you can use the path between the garden and the neighbor's house, or the small village square 100 m near the war memorial. Pétanque: you can play boules on the small village square 100 m near the war memorial.

# Piano
It's an old gentleman that has been renovated recently, please take care of it, but it's just begging to be used!

# Nordic bath
If you took this option, the water has been changed for you. The bath is a natural tool, the water is not treated, the larch being naturally fungicidal. There may be some dust deposits at the bottom, birds or wind may bring in impurities.

To go in the evening, light the fire in the morning. If you used it the day before, it will warm up much faster, you can turn it on later in the day.
There are boards to prevent birds from going to drink in the bath, remove them when there is a fire and put them back afterwards. In fact, birds often drown if we give them access (they have other water points in the village, don't worry!!)


- Prepare some kindling. In the middle of the barn, there is a block, a billhook and an axe. Watch your fingers. On the barbecue next to the stable fridge, there are matches and firelighters.
- Place two or three logs flat at the bottom of the stove.
- On these logs, light the fire with the kindling
- When it is well set, add pieces of wood of increasing size, to finish with whole logs
- When the fire is really strong (the smoke comes out of the chimney at the top, the flames come out of the stove), place the stove lid, leaving the air inlet open
- Maintain the fire regularly by monitoring the water temperature
- Leave the wooden lids on the bath, it will heat up faster
- When the temperature is sufficient, close the air supply (by sliding the cover to the right)
- BE CAREFUL, if you charge too much at this time, the bath will continue to rise in temperature and you will have to wait for it to cool down before using it.
- At the beginning the water is hot at the top and cold at the bottom. When you enter the bath you will stir it.



# Departure
You are asked to leave the gîte by 1 p.m., to allow the gîte to be prepared for the following tenants. Most often it is not re-rented in the evening, so you can stay longer, ask me for confirmation the day before
